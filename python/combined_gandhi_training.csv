"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Kashmir Issue (Speech at the Prayer Meeting on 4th January 1948) Today there is talk of war everywhere
What would Gandhi say?,Everyone fears a war breaking out between the two countries
Tell me about truth and love:,If that happens it will be a calamity both for India and for Pakistan
"Guide me, Gandhi:",because whenever there is a fear of conflict anywhere the U.N
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",is asked to promote a settlement and to stop fighting from breaking out
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","however trivial the issue may appear to be, it could lead to a war between the two countries"
What would Gandhi say?,It is a long memorandum and it has been cabled
Tell me about truth and love:,Pakistan's leaders Zafrullah Khan and Liaquat Ali Khan have since issued long statements
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I would take leave to say that their argument does not appeal to me
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",You may ask if I approve of the Union Government approaching the UNO I may say that I both approve and do not approve of what they did
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I approve of it, because after all what else are they to do"
What would Gandhi say?,They are convinced that what they are doing is right
Tell me about truth and love:,"If there are raids from outside the frontier of Kashmir, the obvious conclusion is that it must be with the connivance of Pakistan"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",But the denial does not settle the matter
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Kashmir has acceded the accession upon certain conditions
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If Pakistan harasses Kashmir and if Sheikh Abdullah who is the leader of Kashmir asks the Indian Union for help, the latter is bound to send help"
What would Gandhi say?,Such help therefore was sent to Kashmir
Tell me about truth and love:,At the same time Pakistan is being requested to get out of Kashmir and to arrive at a settlement with India over the question through bilateral negotiations
"Guide me, Gandhi:",If no settlement can be reached in this way then a war is inevitable
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is to avoid the possibility of war that the Union Government has taken the step it did
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Whether they are right in doing so or not God alone knows
What would Gandhi say?,"Whatever might have been the attitude of Pakistan, if I had my way I would have invited Pakistan's representatives to India and we could have met, discussed the matter and worked out some settlement"
Tell me about truth and love:,They keep saying that they want an amicable settlement but they do nothing to create the conditions for such a settlement
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I shall therefore humbly say to the responsible leaders of Pakistan that though we are now two countries  -  which is a thing I never wanted  -  we should at least try to arrive at an agreement so that we could live as peaceful neighbors
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Let us grant for the sake of argument that all Indians are bad, but Pakistan at least is a new-born nation which has more ever come into being in the name of religion and it should at least keep itself clean"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",But they themselves make no such claim
What would Gandhi say?,It is not their argument that Muslims have committed no atrocities in Pakistan
Tell me about truth and love:,"I shall therefore suggest that it is now their duty, as far as possible, to arrive at an amicable understanding with India and live in harmony with her"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Mistakes were made on both sides
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","But this does not mean that we should persist in those mistakes, for then in the end we shall only destroy ourselves in a war and the whole of the sub-continent will pass into the hands of some third power"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",That will be the worst imaginable fate for us
What would Gandhi say?,Therefore the two Dominions should come together with God as witness and find a settlement
Tell me about truth and love:,The matter is now before the UNO
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It cannot be withdrawn from there
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But if India and Pakistan come to a settlement the big powers in the UNO will have to endorse that settlement
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",They will not object to the settlement
What would Gandhi say?,They themselves can only say that they will do their best to see that the two countries arrive at an understanding through mutual discussions
Tell me about truth and love:,Let us pray to God is to grant that we may either learn to live in amity with each other or if we must light to let us fight to the very end
"Guide me, Gandhi:",That may be folly but sooner or later it will purify us
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I came to know of the incidents which took place last evening through Brijkishan
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I had gone to the Camp for the evening prayer
What would Gandhi say?,I came away after the prayer but he had stayed over to talk to the people in the Camp
Tell me about truth and love:,There are some Muslim houses at as little distance from the Camp
"Guide me, Gandhi:",About four or five hundred inmates of the Camp mostly women and children but also some men  -  issued out of the Camp to take possession of the houses
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I am told they did not indulge in any kind of violence
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Some were occupied by the owners
What would Gandhi say?,They tried to take possession even of the latter
Tell me about truth and love:,They immediately went to the spot and brought the situation under control at about 9 O' clock according to the information I have
"Guide me, Gandhi:",The police have stayed on there
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I understand they had to use tear gas
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Tear gas does not kill but it can be pretty painful
What would Gandhi say?,I am told that something has happened today again
Tell me about truth and love:,All I can say is that is a matter of great shame for us
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Have not the refugees learnt even from their immense suffering that they have to exercise some restraint
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is highly improper to go and occupy other people's houses
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is for the Government to find them shelter or whatever else their need
What would Gandhi say?,Today the Government is our own
Tell me about truth and love:,But if we defy our own Government and defy the police and forcibly occupy houses the Government is not likely to continue for long
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It is still worse that such things should happen in the capital city of India where there are so many ambassadors from all over the world
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Do we want to show them the spectacle of people occupying what-ever they can
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is all the more regrettable that women and children were used as a shield
What would Gandhi say?,It is like Muslim rulers keeping a herd of cows in the anguard of their armies to make sure that the Hindus would not fight
Tell me about truth and love:,"It is uncivilized, barbaric behavior"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It is still more barbaric to put women and children in front to provide against the police making a lathi charge
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I must humbly ask all the refugees - women and children  -  not to behave in this way
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If they don't, then apart from a war between Indian and Pakistan, we may kill ourselves in mutual strife"
What would Gandhi say?,We may lose Delhi and make ourselves the laughing-stock of the world
Tell me about truth and love:,"If we want to keep India a free country, we must stop the things that are at present going on"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Reception in Madras (21.4.1915) In reply to the Welcome address read by Mr
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Natesan on behalf of the Indian South African League, at a meeting at the Victoria Public Hall, Madras, on the 21st April 1915, with Dr"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Sir Subramania Iyer in the Chair, Mr"
What would Gandhi say?,"If there is anything that we have deserved, as has been stated in this beautiful address, I can only say I lay it at the feet of my Master under whose inspiration I have been working all this time under exile in South Africa"
Tell me about truth and love:,In so far as the sentiments expressed in this address are merely prophetic
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Sir, I accept them as a blessing and as a prayer from you and from this great meeting that both my wife and I myself may possess the power, the inclination, and the life to dedicate whatever we may develop in this sacred land of ours to the service of the Motherland"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is no wonder that we have come to Madras
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Natesan, will perhaps tell you, we have been overdue and we have neglected Madras"
What would Gandhi say?,But we have done nothing of the kind
Tell me about truth and love:,We know that we had a corner in your hearts and we knew that you will not misjudge us if we did not hasten to Madras before going to the other presidencies and to other towns
"Guide me, Gandhi:","What language do you propose to use for Magappan and Narayansawmy, lads of seventeen or eighteen years, who braved in simple faith all the trials, all the sufferings, and all the indignities for the sake of the honour of the Motherland (Cheers)"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","What language do you propose to use with reference to Valliamma, that sweet girl of seventeen years who was discharged from Maritzburg prison, skin and bone suffering from fever to which she succumbed after about a month's time (Cries of shame)"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It was the Madrasis who of all the Indians were singled out by the great Divinity that rules over us for this great work
What would Gandhi say?,"You have said that I inspired these great men and women, but I cannot accept that proposition"
Tell me about truth and love:,"It was they, the simple-minded folk, who worked away in faith, never expecting the slightest reward, who inspired me, who kept me to the proper level , and who inspired me by their great sacrifice, by their great faith, by their great trust in the great God, to do the work that I was able to do"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","It is my misfortune that my wife and I have been obliged to work in the lime-light, and you have magnified out of all proportion (cries of 'No"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",No?') this little work we have been able to do
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The inspiration was given by them to us, and we were able to be interpreters between the powers who called themselves the Governors and those men for whom redress was so necessary"
What would Gandhi say?,We were simply links between those two parties and nothing more
Tell me about truth and love:,"It was my duty, having received the education that was given to me by my parents to interpret what was going on in our midst to those simple folk, and they rose to the occasion"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","They realised the might of religious force, and it was they who inspired us, and let them who have finished their work, and who have died for you and me, let them inspire you and us"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","We are still living and who knows whether the devil will not possess us tomorrow and we shall not forsake the post of duty before any new danger that may face us, But these three have gone for ever"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","An old man of 75 from the United Provinces, Harbart Singh, has also joined the majority and died in jail in South Africa; and he deserved the crown that you would seek to impose upon us"
What would Gandhi say?,"These young men deserve all the adjectives that you have so affectionately, but blindly lavished upon us"
Tell me about truth and love:,"It was not only the Hindus who struggled, but there were Mohamedans, Parsis and Christians, and almost every part of India was represented in the struggled"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","They realised the common danger, and they realised also what their destiny was an Indians, and it was they, and they alone, who matched the soul-forces against the physical forces"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",(Loud applause.) Source : Speeches and Writings of Gandhi
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Shankarlal Ghelabhai Banker, editor, and printer and publisher respectively of Young India, on charges under Section 124 A of the Indian Penal Code, was held on Saturday, 18th March 1922, before Mr"
What would Gandhi say?,"S., District and Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad.] Sir J"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Strangman, Advocate-General, with Rao Bahadur Girdharlal Uttamram, Public Prosecutor of Ahmedabad, appeared for the Crown"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Wild, Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, was also present"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Among the members of the public who were present on the occasion were : Kasturba Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, Pandit M"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The Judge, who took his seat at 12 noon, said that there was slight mistake in the charges were then read out by the Registrar"
What would Gandhi say?,"The offending articles were then read out : first of them was, ""Tampering with Loyalty""; and second, ""The Puzzle and its Solution"", and the last was ""Shaking the Manes"""
Tell me about truth and love:,The Judge said that the law required that the charges should not be read out but explained
"Guide me, Gandhi:",In this case it would not be necessary for him to say much by way of explanation
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The charge in each case was that of bringing or attempting to excite into hatred or contempt or exciting or attempting to excite disaffection towards His Majesty's Government, established by law in British India"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The charges having been read out, the Judge called upon the accused to plead to the charges"
What would Gandhi say?,He asked Gandhiji whether he pleaded guilty or claimed to be tried
Tell me about truth and love:,"Gandhiji said : ""I plead guilty to all the charges"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I observe that the King's name has been omitted from the charge, and it has been properly omitted."" The Judge asked Shri banker the same question and he too readily pleaded guilty"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The Judge wished to give his verdict immediately after Gandhiji had pleaded guilty, but Sir Strangman insisted that the procedure should be carried out in full"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The Advocate-General requested the Judge to take into account ""the occurrences in Bombay, Malabar and Chauri Chaura, leading to rioting and murder"""
What would Gandhi say?,"As regards Shri Banker, the second accused, the offence was lesser"
Tell me about truth and love:,He did the publication but did not write
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Sir Strangman's instructions were that Shri Banker was a man of means and he requested the court to impose a substantial fine in addition to such term of imprisonment as might be inflicted upon
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Gandhi, do you wish to make any statement on the question of sentence"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Gandhiji : I would like to make a statement
What would Gandhi say?,Court : Could you give me in writing to put it on record
Tell me about truth and love:,Gandhiji : I shall give it as soon as I finish it
"Guide me, Gandhi:",[Gandhiji then made the following oral statement followed by a written statement that he read.] Before I read this statement I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned Advocate-General's remarks in connection with my humble self
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Thinking over these things deeply and sleeping over them night after night, it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chauri Chaura or the mad outrages of Bombay"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","He is quite right when he says, that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should have known the consequences of every one of my acts"
What would Gandhi say?,I knew that I was playing with fire
Tell me about truth and love:,I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty, if I did not say what I said here just now"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Non-violence is the first article of my faith
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is also the last article of my creed
What would Gandhi say?,"I had either to submit to a system which I considered had done an irreparable harm to my country, or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips"
Tell me about truth and love:,I know that my people have sometimes gone mad
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I am deeply sorry for it and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light penalty but to the highest penalty"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I do not plead any extenating act
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I am here, therefore, to invite and cheerfully submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen"
What would Gandhi say?,"The only course open to you, the Judge, is, as I am going to say in my statement, either to resign your post, or inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and law you are assisting to administer are good for the people"
Tell me about truth and love:,I do not except that kind of conversion
"Guide me, Gandhi:",But by the time I have finished with my statement you will have a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to run this maddest risk which a sane man can run
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",To the court too I should say why I plead guilty to the charge of promoting disaffection towards the Government established by law in India
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",My public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled weather
What would Gandhi say?,My first contact with British authority in that country was not of a happy character
Tell me about truth and love:,"I discovered that as a man and an Indian, I had no rights"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","More 
correctly I discovered that I had no rights as a man because I was an Indian"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I thought that this treatment of Indians was an excrescence upon a system that was intrinsically and mainly good
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I gave the Government my voluntary and hearty co-operation, criticizing it freely where I felt it was faulty but never wishing its destruction"
What would Gandhi say?,"Consequently when the existence of the Empire was threatened in 1899 by the Boer challenge, I offered my services to it, raised a volunteer ambulance corps and served at several actions that took place for the relief of Ladysmith"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Similarly in 1906, at the time of the Zulu 'revolt', I raised a stretcher bearer party and served till the end of the 'rebellion'"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",On both the occasions I received medals and was even mentioned in dispatches
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",For my work in South Africa I was given by Lord Hardinge a Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","When the war broke out in 1914 between England and Germany, I raised a volunteer ambulance cars in London, consisting of the then resident Indians in London, chiefly students"
What would Gandhi say?,Its work was acknowledge by the authorities to be valuable
Tell me about truth and love:,"In all these efforts at service, I was actuated by the belief that it was possible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the Empire for my countrymen"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",The first shock came in the shape of the Rowlatt Act-a law designed to rob the people of all real freedom
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I felt called upon to lead an intensive agitation against it
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Then followed the Punjab horrors beginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating in crawling orders, public flogging and other indescribable humiliations"
What would Gandhi say?,I discovered too that the plighted word of the Prime Minister to the Mussalmans of India regarding the integrity of Turkey and the holy places of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled
Tell me about truth and love:,But all that hope was shattered
"Guide me, Gandhi:",The Khilafat promise was not to be redeemed
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The Punjab crime was whitewashed and most culprits went not only unpunished but remained in service, and some continued to draw pensions from the Indian revenue and in some cases were even rewarded"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I saw too that not only did the reforms not mark a change of heart, but they were only a method of further raining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude"
What would Gandhi say?,"I came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically and economically"
Tell me about truth and love:,"A disarmed India has no power of resistance against any aggressor if she wanted to engage, in an armed conflict with him"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","So much is this the case that some of our best men consider that India must take generations, before she can achieve Dominion Status"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",She has become so poor that she has little power of resisting famines
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Before the British advent India spun and wove in her millions of cottages, just the supplement she needed for adding to her meagre agricultural resources"
What would Gandhi say?,"This cottage industry, so vital for India's existence, has been ruined by incredibly heartless and inhuman processes as described by English witness"
Tell me about truth and love:,Little do town dwellers how the semi-starved masses of India are slowly sinking to lifelessness
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Little do they know that their miserable comfort represents the brokerage they get for their work they do for the foreign exploiter, that the profits and the brokerage are sucked from the masses"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Little do realize that the Government established by law in British India is carried on for this exploitation of the masses
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","No sophistry, no jugglery in figures, can explain away the evidence that the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye"
What would Gandhi say?,"I have no doubt whatsoever that both England and the town dweller of India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime against humanity, which is perhaps unequalled in history"
Tell me about truth and love:,The law itself in this country has been used to serve the foreign exploiter
"Guide me, Gandhi:",My unbiased examination of the Punjab Marital Law cases has led me to believe that at least ninety-five per cent of convictions were wholly bad
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","My experience of political cases in India leads me to the conclusion, in nine out of every ten, the condemned men were totally innocent"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Their crime consisted in the love of their country
What would Gandhi say?,"In ninety-nine cases out of hundred, justice has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the courts of India"
Tell me about truth and love:,This is not an exaggerated picture
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It is the experience of almost every Indian who has had anything to do with such cases
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","In my opinion, the administration of the law is thus prostituted, consciously or unconsciously, for the benefit of the exploiter"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The greater misfortune is that the Englishmen and their Indian associates in the administration of the country do not know that they are engaged in the crime I have attempted to describe
What would Gandhi say?,"I am satisfied that many Englishmen and Indian officials honestly systems devised in the world, and that India is making steady, though, slow progress"
Tell me about truth and love:,This awful habit has added to the ignorance and the self-deception of the administrators
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Section 124 A, under which I am happily charged, is perhaps the prince among the political sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the liberty of the citizen"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If one has no affection for a person or system, one should be free to give the fullest expression to his disaffection, so long as he does not contemplate, promote, or incite to violence"
What would Gandhi say?,But the section under which mere promotion of disaffection is a crime
Tell me about truth and love:,I have studied some of the cases tried under it; I know that some of the most loved of India's patriots have been convicted under it
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I consider it a privilege, therefore, to be charged under that section"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I have endeavored to give in their briefest outline the reasons for my disaffection
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I have no personal ill-will against any single administrator, much less can I have any disaffection towards the King's person"
What would Gandhi say?,But I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected towards a Government which in its totality has done more harm to India than any previous system
Tell me about truth and love:,India is less manly under the British rule than she ever was before
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Holding such a belief, I consider it to be a sin to have affection for the system"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",And it has been a precious privilege for me to be able to write what I have in the various articles tendered in evidence against me
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","In fact, I believe that I have rendered a service to India and England by showing in non-co-operation the way out of the unnatural state in which both are living"
What would Gandhi say?,"In my opinion, non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with good"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But in the past, non-co-operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the evil-doer"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I am endeavoring to show to my countrymen that violent non-co-operation only multiples evil, and that as evil can only be sustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from violence"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Non-violence implies voluntary submission to the penalty for non-co-operation with evil
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is deliberate crime, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen"
What would Gandhi say?,"On the eve of Dandi March (11.3.1930) [On the 11th of March 1930,the crowd swelled to 10,000 at the evening prayer held on the Sabarmati sands at Ahmedabad"
Tell me about truth and love:,"At the end, Gandhiji delivered a memorable speech on the eve of his historic march:] In all probability this will be my last speech to you"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Even if the Government allow me to march tomorrow morning, this will be my last speech on the sacred banks of the Sabarmati"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Possibly these may be the last words of my life here
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I have already told you yesterday what I had to say
What would Gandhi say?,Today I shall confine myself to what you should do after my companions and I are arrested
Tell me about truth and love:,The programme of the march to Jalalpur must be fulfilled as originally settled
"Guide me, Gandhi:",The enlistment of the volunteers for this purpose should be confined to Gujarat only
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","From what I have been and heard during the last fortnight, I am inclined to believe that the stream of civil resisters will flow unbroken"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",But let there be not a semblance of breach of peace even after all of us have been arrested
What would Gandhi say?,We have resolved to utilize all our resources in the pursuit of an exclusively nonviolent struggle
Tell me about truth and love:,Let no one commit a wrong in anger
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I wish these words of mine reached every nook and corner of the land
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",My task shall be done if I perish and so do my comrades
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It will then be for the Working Committee of the Congress to show you the way and it will be up to you to follow its lead
What would Gandhi say?,"So long as I have reached Jalalpur, let nothing be done in contravention to the authority vested in me by the Congress"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But once I am arrested, the whole responsibility shifts to the Congress"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","No one who believes in non-violence, as a creed, need, therefore, sit still"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",My compact with the Congress ends as soon as I am arrested
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Wherever possible, civil disobedience of salt should be started"
What would Gandhi say?,These laws can be violated in three ways
Tell me about truth and love:,It is an offence to manufacture salt wherever there are facilities for doing so
"Guide me, Gandhi:","The possession and sale of contraband salt, which includes natural salt or salt earth, is also an offence"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The purchasers of such salt will be equally guilty
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",To carry away the natural salt deposits on the seashore is likewise violation of law
What would Gandhi say?,"In short, you may choose any one or all of these devices to break the salt monopoly"
Tell me about truth and love:,"We are, however, not to be content with this alone"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",There is no ban by the Congress and wherever the local workers have self-confidence other suitable measures may be adopted
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I stress only one condition, namely, let our pledge of truth and nonviolence as the only means for the attainment of Swaraj be faithfully kept"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","For the rest, every one has a free hand"
What would Gandhi say?,"But, than does not give a license to all and sundry to carry on their own responsibility"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Wherever there are local leaders, their orders should be obeyed by the people"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Where there are no leaders and only a handful of men have faith in the programme, they may do what they can, if they have enough self-confidence"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","They have a right, nay it is their duty, to do so"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The history of the is full of instances of men who rose to leadership, by sheer force of self-confidence, bravery and tenacity"
What would Gandhi say?,"We too, if we sincerely aspire to Swaraj and are impatient to attain it, should have similar self-confidence"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Our ranks will swell and our hearts strengthen, as the number of our arrests by the Government increases"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Much can be done in many other ways besides these
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The Liquor and foreign cloth shops can be picketed
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",We can refuse to pay taxes if we have the requisite strength
What would Gandhi say?,The lawyers can give up practice
Tell me about truth and love:,The public can boycott the law courts by refraining from litigation
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Government servants can resign their posts
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",In the midst of the despair reigning all round people quake with fear of losing employment
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The number of Government servants in the country does not exceed a few hundred thousands
What would Gandhi say?,Even free India will not be able to accommodate a greater number of public servants
Tell me about truth and love:,"A Collector then will not need the number of servants, he has got today"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Our starving millions can by no means afford this enormous expenditure
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If, therefore, we are sensible enough, let us bid good-bye to Government employment, no matter if it is the post of a judge or a peon"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Let all who are co-operating with the Government in one way or another, be it by paying taxes, keeping titles, or sending children to official schools, etc"
What would Gandhi say?,withdraw their co-operation in all or as many watts as possible
Tell me about truth and love:,Then there are women who can stand shoulder to shoulder with men in this struggle
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It was the message that I desired to impart to you before starting on the march or for the jail
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I wish that there should be no suspension or abandonment of the war that commences tomorrow morning or earlier, if I am arrested before that time"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I shall eagerly await the news that ten batches are ready as soon as my batch is arrested
What would Gandhi say?,I believe there are men in India to complete the work our begun by me
Tell me about truth and love:,I have faith in the righteousness of our cause and the purity of our weapons
"Guide me, Gandhi:","And where the means are clean, there God is undoubtedly present with His blessings"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","And where these three combine, there defeat is an impossibility"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","A Satyagrahi, whether free or incarcerated, is ever victorious"
What would Gandhi say?,"He is vanquished only, when he forsakes truth and nonviolence and turns a deaf ear to the inner voice"
Tell me about truth and love:,"If, therefore, there is such a thing as defeat for even a Satyagrahi, he alone is the cause of it"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",God bless you all and keep off all obstacles from the path in the struggle that begins tomorrow
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Speech at Round Table Conference (30.11.1931) It will be after all and at best a paper solution
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But immediately you withdraw that wedge, the domestic ties, the domestic affection, the knowledge of common birth  -  do you suppose that all these will count for nothing"
What would Gandhi say?,"Were Hindus and Mussalmans and Sikhs always at war with one another when there was no British rule, when there was no English face seen there"
Tell me about truth and love:,We have chapter and verse given to us by Hindu historians and by Mussalman historians to say that we were living in comparative peace even then
"Guide me, Gandhi:",And Hindus and Mussalmans in the villages are not even today quarrelling
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",In those days they were not known to quarrel at all
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The late Maulana Muhammad Ali often used to tell me, and he was himself a bit of an historian"
What would Gandhi say?,And so have Hindu historians written
Tell me about truth and love:,This quarrel is not old; this quarrel is coeval with this acute shame
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I do not intend to say much tonight about the Princes, but I should be wronging them and should be wronging the Congress if I did not register my claim, not with the Round Table Conference but with the Princes"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is open to the Princes to give their terms on which they will join the Federation
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I have appealed to them to make the path easy for those who inhabit the other part of India, and therefore, I can only make these suggestions for their favourable consideration, for their earnest consideration"
What would Gandhi say?,"They would have gone a long way to show to the world and to show to the whole of India that they are also fired with a democratic spirit, that they do not want to remain undiluted autocrats, but that they want to become constitutional monarch even as King George of Great Britain is"
Tell me about truth and love:,"An Autonomous Frontier Province : Let India get what she is entitled to and what she can really take, but whatever she gets, and whenever she gets it, let the Frontier Province get complete autonomy today"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","That Frontier will then be a standing demonstration to the whole of India, and therefore, the whole vote of the Congress will be given in favour of the Frontier Province getting provincial Autonomy tomorrow"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Thanks: Last of all, my last is pleasant task for me"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",This is perhaps the last time that I shall be sitting with you at negotiations
What would Gandhi say?,I want to sit at the same table with you in your closets and to negotiate and to plead with you and to go down on bended knees before I take the final lead and final plunge
Tell me about truth and love:,But whether I have the good fortune to continue to tender my co-operation or not does not depend upon me
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It depends upon so many circumstances over which neither you nor we may have any control whatsoever
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Then, let me perform this pleasant task of giving my thanks to all form Their Majesties down to the poorest men in the East End where I have taken up my habitation"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","In that settlement, which represent the poor people of the East End of London, I have become one of them"
What would Gandhi say?,"They have accepted me as a member, and as a favoured member of their family"
Tell me about truth and love:,It will be one of the richest treasures that I shall carry with me
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Here, too, I have found nothing but courtesy and nothing but a genuine affection from all with whom I have come in touch"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I have come in touch with so many Englishmen
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","It has been a priceless privilege to me, They have listened to what must have often appeared to them to be unpleasant, although it was true"
What would Gandhi say?,Although I have often been obliged to say these things to them they have never shown the slightest impatience or irritation
Tell me about truth and love:,It is impossible for me to forget these things
"Guide me, Gandhi:","No matter what befalls me, no matter what the fortunes may be of this Round Table Conference, one thing I shall certainly carry with me, that is, that from high to low I have found nothing but the utmost courtesy and that utmost affection"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I consider that it was well worth my paying this visit to England in order to find this human affection
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The operatives, men and women, hugged me"
What would Gandhi say?,They treated me as one of their own
Tell me about truth and love:,I am carrying with me thousands upon thousands of English friendship
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I do not know them but I read that affection in their eyes as early in the morning I walk through your streets
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","All this hospitality, all this kindness will never be effaced from my memory, no matter what befalls my unhappy land"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I thank you for your forbearance
What would Gandhi say?,Benaras Hindu University Speech (4.2.1916) [Pandit Malaviya had invited Gandhiji to speak on the occasion of the opening of the Banaras Hindu University
Tell me about truth and love:,"Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy, had come specially to lay the foundation-stone of the University"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",To protect his life extra precautions were taken by the police
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",They were omnipresent and all houses along the route were guarded
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Banaras was, so to say, in a state of siege]"
What would Gandhi say?,Eminent persons from all over India had come
Tell me about truth and love:,Many of them delivered addresses
"Guide me, Gandhi:","On February 4, 1916 it was Gandhiji's turn to address the audience, mostly consisting of impressionable youths"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","A galaxy of princes, bedecked and bejeweled, had occupied the dias"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The Maharaja of Darbhanga was in the chair
What would Gandhi say?,"Gandhiji who was clad in a short, coarse dhoti, Kathiawadi cloak and turban rose to speak"
Tell me about truth and love:,The police precautions and the luxury around him hurt him deeply
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Turning to the audience, Gandhiji said that he wanted to think audibly-speak without reserve: I wish to tender my humble apology for the long delay that took place before I was able to reach this place"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",And you will readily accept the apology when I tell you that I am not responsible for the delay nor is any human agency responsible for it
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The fact is that I am like an animal on show, and my keepers in their over kindness always manage to neglect a necessary chapter in this life, and, that is, pure accident"
What would Gandhi say?,"In this case, they did not provide for the series of accidents that happened to us-to me, keepers, and my carriers"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Friends, under the influence of the matchless eloquence of Mrs"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Besant who has just sat down, pray, do not believe that our University has become a finished product, and that all the young men who are to come to the University, that has yet to rise and come into existence, have also come and returned from it finished citizens of a great empire"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","You will never be able merely through the lip, to give the message that India, I hope, will one day deliver to the world"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I myself have been fed up with speeches and lectures
What would Gandhi say?,"I except the lectures that have been delivered here during the last two days from this category, because they are necessary"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But I do venture to suggest to you that we have now reached almost the end of our resources in speech-making; it is not enough that our ears are feasted, that our eyes are feasted, but it is necessary that our hearts have got to be touched and that out hands and feet have got to be moved"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","We have been told during the last two days how necessary it is, if we are to retain our hold upon the simplicity of Indian character, that our hands and feet should move in unison with our hearts"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But this is only by way of preface
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I wanted to say it is a matter of deep humiliation and shame for us that I am compelled this evening under the shadow of this great college, in this sacred city, to address my countrymen in a language that is foreign to me"
What would Gandhi say?,"I know that if I was appointed an examiner, to examine all those who have been attending during these two days this series of lectures, most of those who might be examined upon these lectures would fail"
Tell me about truth and love:,Because they have not been touched
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I was present at the sessions of the great Congress in the month of December
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","There was a much vaster audience, and will you believe me when I tell you that the only speeches that touched the huge audience in Bombay were the speeches that were delivered in Hindustani"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","In Bombay, mind you, not in Benaras where everybody speaks Hindi"
What would Gandhi say?,I am hoping that this University will see to it that the youths who come to it will receive their instruction through the medium of their vernaculars
Tell me about truth and love:,"Our languages the reflection of ourselves, and if you tell me that our languages are too poor to express the best thought, then say that the sooner we are wiped out of existence the better for us"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Is there a man who dreams that English can ever become the national language of India
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Why this handicap on the nation
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Just consider for one moment what an equal race our lads have to run with every English lad
What would Gandhi say?,I had the privilege of a close conversation with some Poona professors
Tell me about truth and love:,"They assured me that every Indian youth, because he reached his knowledge through the English language, lost at least six precious years of life"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Multiply that by the numbers of students turned out by our schools and colleges, and find out for yourselves how many thousand years have been lost to the nation"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The charge against us is that we have no initiative
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","How can we have any, if we are to devote the precious years of our life to the mastery of a foreign tongue"
What would Gandhi say?,Was it possible for any speaker yesterday and today to impress his audience as was possible for Mr
Tell me about truth and love:,It was not the fault of the previous speakers that they could not engage the audience
"Guide me, Gandhi:",They had more than substance enough for us in their addresses
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But their addresses could not go home to us
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I have heard it said that after all it is English educated India which is leading and which is leading and which is doing all the things for the nation
What would Gandhi say?,It would be monstrous if it were otherwise
Tell me about truth and love:,The only education we receive is English education
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Surely we must show something for it
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","But suppose that we had been receiving during the past fifty years education through our vernaculars, what should we have today"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Today even our wives are not the sharers in our best thought
What would Gandhi say?,Look at Professor Bose and Professor Ray and their brilliant researches
Tell me about truth and love:,Is it not a shame that their researches are not the common property of the masses
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Let us now turn to another subject
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The Congress has passed a resolution about self-government, and I have no doubt that the All-India Congress Committee and the Muslim League will do their duty and come forward with some tangible suggestions"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But I, for one, must frankly confess that I am not so much interested in what they will be able to produce as I am interested in anything that the student world is going to produce or the masses are going to produce"
What would Gandhi say?,No paper contribution will ever give us self-government
Tell me about truth and love:,No amount of speeches will ever make us fit for self-government
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It is only our conduct that will fit for us it
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",And how are we trying to govern ourselves
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I want to think audibly this evening
What would Gandhi say?,"I visited the Vishwanath temple last evening, and ad I was walking through those lanes, these were the thoughts that touched me"
Tell me about truth and love:,"If a stranger dropped from above on to this great temple, and he had to consider what we as Hindus were, would he not be justified in condemning us"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Is not this great temple a reflection of our own character
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Is it right that the lanes of our sacred temple should be as dirty as they are
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The houses round about are built anyhow
What would Gandhi say?,The lanes are tortuous and narrow
Tell me about truth and love:,"If even our temples are not models of roominess and cleanliness, what can our self-government be"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Shall our temples be abodes of holiness, cleanliness and peace as soon as the English have retired from India, either of their own pleasure or by compulsion, bag and baggage"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I entirely agree with the President of the Congress that before we think of self-government, we shall have to do the necessary plodding"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","In every city there are two divisions, the cantonment and the city proper"
What would Gandhi say?,The city mostly is a stinking den
Tell me about truth and love:,But we are a people unused to city life
"Guide me, Gandhi:","But if we want city life, we cannot reproduce the easy-going hamlet life"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is not comforting to think that people walk about the streets of Indian Bombay under the perpetual fear of dwellers in the storeyed building spitting upon them
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I do a great deal of railway traveling
What would Gandhi say?,I observe the difficulty of third-class passengers
Tell me about truth and love:,But the railway administration is by no means to blame for all their hard lot
"Guide me, Gandhi:",We do not know the elementary laws of cleanliness
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","We spit anywhere on the carriage floor, irrespective of the thoughts that it is often used as sleeping space"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",We do not trouble ourselves as to how we use it; the result is indescribable filth in the compartment
What would Gandhi say?,The so-called better class passengers overawe their less fortunate brethren
Tell me about truth and love:,Among them I have seen the student world also; sometimes they behave no better
"Guide me, Gandhi:","They can speak English and they have worn Norfolk jackets and, therefore, claim the right to force their way in and command seating accommodation"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I have turned the searchlight all over, and as you have given me the privilege of speaking to you, I am laying my heart bare"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Surely we must set these things right in our progress towards self-government
What would Gandhi say?,I now introduce you to another scene
Tell me about truth and love:,His Highness the Maharaja who presided yesterday over our deliberations spoke about the poverty of India
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Other speakers laid great stress upon it
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But what did we witness in the great pandal in which the foundation ceremony was performed by the Viceroy
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Certainly a most gorgeous show, an exhibition of jewellery, which made a splendid feast for the eyes of the greatest jeweler who chose to come from Paris"
What would Gandhi say?,I compare with the richly bedecked noble men the millions of the poor
Tell me about truth and love:,"I would undertake, at the peril of my life, to bring to you a message from King George himself that he excepts nothing of the kind"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Higginbotham told us last night in his own felicitous language, that they are the men who grow two blades of grass in the place of one"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","But there cannot be much spirit of self-government about us, if we take away or allow others to take away from them almost the whole of the results of their labour"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Our salvation can only come through the farmer
What would Gandhi say?,"Neither the lawyers, nor the doctors, nor the rich landlords are going to secure it"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Now, last but not the least, it is my bounden duty to refer to what agitated our minds during these two or three days"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",All of us have had many anxious moments while the Viceroy was going through the streets of Banaras
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",There were detectives stationed in many places
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","We asked ourselves, ""Why this distrust?"" Is it not better that even Lord Hardinge should die than live a living death"
What would Gandhi say?,But a representative of a mighty sovereign may not
Tell me about truth and love:,He might find it necessary to impose these detectives on us
"Guide me, Gandhi:","We may foam, we may fret, we may resent, but let us not forget that India of today in her impatience has produced an army of anarchists"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I myself am an anarchist, but of another type"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But there is a class of anarchists amongst us, and if I was able to reach this class, I would say to them that their anarchism has no room in India, if India is to conqueror"
What would Gandhi say?,"If we trust and fear God, we shall have to fear no one, not the Maharajas, not the Viceroys, not the detectives, not even King George"
Tell me about truth and love:,I honour the anarchist for his love of the country
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I honour him for his bravery in being willing to die for his country; but I ask him-is killing honourable
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Is the dagger of an assassin a fit precursor of an honourable death
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",There is no warrant for such methods in any scriptures
What would Gandhi say?,"If I found it necessary for the salvation of India that the English should retire, that they should be driven out, I would not hesitate to declare that they would have to go, and I hope I would be prepared to die in defense of that belief"
Tell me about truth and love:,"That would, in my opinion, be an honourable death"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","The bomb-thrower creates secret plots, is afraid to come out into the open, and when caught pays the penalty of misdirected zeal"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I have been told, ""Had we not done this, had some people not thrown bombs, we should never have gained what we have got with reference to the partition movement."" (Mrs"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Besant : 'Please stop it.') This was what I said in Bengal when Mr
What would Gandhi say?,I think what I am saying is necessary
Tell me about truth and love:,If I am told to stop I shall obey
"Guide me, Gandhi:",(Turning to the Chairman) I await your orders
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If you consider that by my speaking as I am, I am not serving the country and the empire I shall certainly stop"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","(Cries of 'Go on.') (The Chairman: 'Please, explain your object.') I am simply"
What would Gandhi say?,"My friends, please do not resent this interruption"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Besant this evening suggests that I should stop, she does so because she loves India so well, and she considers that I am erring in thinking audibly before you young men"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","But even so, I simply say this, that I want to purge India of this atmosphere of suspicion on either side, if we are to reach our goal; we should have an empire which is to be based upon mutual love and mutual trust"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Is it not better that we talk under the shadow of this college than that we should be talking irresponsibly in our homes
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I consider that it is much better that we talk these things openly
What would Gandhi say?,I have done so with excellent results before now
Tell me about truth and love:,I know that there is nothing that the students do not know
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I am, therefore, turning the searchlight towards ourselves"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I hold the name of my country so dear to me that I exchange these thoughts with you, and submit to you that there is no room for anarchism in India"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Let us frankly and openly say whatever we want to say our rulers, and face the consequences if what we have to say does not please them"
What would Gandhi say?,I was talking the other day to a member of the much-abused Civil Service
Tell me about truth and love:,"I have not very much in common with the members of that Service, but I could not help admiring the manner in which he was speaking to mw"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Gandhi, do you for one moment suppose that all we, Civil Servants, are a bad lot, that we want to oppress the people whom we have come to govern?"" ""No"", I said"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","""Then if you get an opportunity put in a word for the much-abused Civil Service."" And I am here to put in that word"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Yes, many members of the Indian Civil Service are most decidedly overbearing; they are tyrannical, at times thoughtless"
What would Gandhi say?,Many other adjectives may be used
Tell me about truth and love:,I grant all these things and I grant also that after having lived in India for a certain number of years some of them become somewhat degraded
"Guide me, Gandhi:","They were gentlemen before they came here, and if they have lost some of the moral fiber, it is a reflection upon ourselves"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Just think out for yourselves, if a man who was good yesterday has become bad after having come in contact with me, is he responsible that he has deteriorated or am I"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The atmosphere of sycophancy and falsity that surrounds them on their coming to India demoralizes them, as it would many of us"
What would Gandhi say?,It is well to take the blame sometimes
Tell me about truth and love:,"If we are to receive self-government, we shall have to take it"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",We shall never be granted self-government
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Look at the history of the British Empire and the British nation; freedom loving as it is, it will not be a party to give freedom to a people who will not take it themselves"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Learn your lesson if you wish to from the Boer War
What would Gandhi say?,Those who were enemies of that empire only a few years ago have now become friends
Tell me about truth and love:,(At this point there was an interruption and a movement on the platform to leave
"Guide me, Gandhi:","The speech, therefore, ended here abruptly.) Mahatma, pp"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The 'Quit India' Speech (8.8.1942) {Gandhiji addressed the A.I.C.C
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I ask you to consider it from my point of view, because if you approve of it, you will be enjoined to carry out all I say"
What would Gandhi say?,It will be a great responsibility
Tell me about truth and love:,"There are people who ask me whether I am the same man that I was in 1920, or whether there has been any change in me"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",You are right in asking that question
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Let me, however, hasten to assure that I am the same Gandhi as I was in 1920"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I have not changed in any fundamental respect
What would Gandhi say?,I attach the same importance to nonviolence that I did then
Tell me about truth and love:,"If at all, my emphasis on it has grown stronger"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",There is no real contradiction between the present resolution and my previous writings and utterances
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Occasions like the present do not occur in everybody's and but rarely in anybody's life
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I want you to know and feel that there is nothing but purest Ahimsa in all that I am saying and doing today
What would Gandhi say?,"The draft resolution of the Working Committee is based on Ahimsa, the contemplated struggle similarly has its roots in Ahimsa"
Tell me about truth and love:,"If, therefore, there is any among you who has lost faith in Ahimsa or is wearied of it, let him not vote for this resolution"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Let me explain my position clearly
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",God has vouchsafed to me a priceless gift in the weapon of Ahimsa
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I and my Ahimsa are on our trail today
What would Gandhi say?,"If in the present crisis, when the earth is being scorched by the flames of Hims2 and crying for deliverance, I failed to make use of the God given talent, God will not forgive me and I shall be judged unwrongly of the great gift"
Tell me about truth and love:,"I may not hesitate and merely look on, when Russia and China are threatened"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Ours is not a drive for power, but purely a nonviolent fight for India's independence"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","In a violent struggle, a successful general has been often known to effect a military coup and to set up a dictatorship"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But under the Congress scheme of things, essentially nonviolent as it is, there can be no room for dictatorship"
What would Gandhi say?,"A non-violent soldier of freedom will covet nothing for himself, he fights only for the freedom of his country"
Tell me about truth and love:,"The Congress is unconcerned as to who will rule, when freedom is attained"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","The power, when it comes, will belong to the people of India, and it will be for them to decide to whom it placed in the entrusted"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","May be that the reins will be placed in the hands of the Parsis, for instance-as I would love to see happen-or they may be handed to some others whose names are not heard in the Congress today"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","It will not be for you then to object saying, ""This community is microscopic"
What would Gandhi say?,"That party did not play its due part in the freedom's struggle; why should it have all the power?"" Ever since its inception the Congress has kept itself meticulously free of the communal taint"
Tell me about truth and love:,It has thought always in terms of the whole nation and has acted accordingly
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I know how imperfect our Ahimsa is and how far away we are still from the ideal, but in Ahimsa there is no final failure or defeat"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I have faith, therefore, that if, in spite of our shortcomings, the big thing does happen, it will be because God wanted to help us by crowning with success our silent, unremitting Sadhana1 for the last twenty-two years"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I believe that in the history of the world, there has not been a more genuinely democratic struggle for freedom than ours"
What would Gandhi say?,"I read Carlyle's French Resolution while I was in prison, and Pandit Jawaharlal has told me something about the Russian revolution"
Tell me about truth and love:,But it is my conviction that inasmuch as these struggles were fought with the weapon of violence they failed to realize the democratic ideal
"Guide me, Gandhi:","In the democracy which I have envisaged, a democracy established by nonviolence, there will be equal freedom for all"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Everybody will be his own master
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is to join a struggle for such democracy that I invite you today
What would Gandhi say?,"Once you realize this you will forget the differences between the Hindus and Muslims, and think of yourselves as Indians only, engaged in the common struggle for independence"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Then, there is the question of your attitude towards the British"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I have noticed that there is hatred towards the British among the people
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The people say they are disgusted with their behaviour
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The people make no distinction between British imperialism and the British people
What would Gandhi say?,"To them, the two are one This hatred would even make them welcome the Japanese"
Tell me about truth and love:,It means that they will exchange one slavery for another
"Guide me, Gandhi:",We must get rid of this feeling
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Our quarrel is not with the British people, we fight their imperialism"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The proposal for the withdrawal of British power did not come out of anger
What would Gandhi say?,"We cannot evoke the true spirit of sacrifice and velour, so long as we are not free"
Tell me about truth and love:,"I know the British Government will not be able to withhold freedom from us, when we have made enough self-sacrifice"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","We must, therefore, purge ourselves of hatred"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Speaking for myself, I can say that I have never felt any hatred"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","As a matter of fact, I feel myself to be a greater friend of the British now than ever before"
What would Gandhi say?,One reason is that they are today in distress
Tell me about truth and love:,"My very friendship, therefore, demands that I should try to save them from their mistakes"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","As I view the situation, they are on the brink of an abyss"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","It, therefore, becomes my duty to warn them of their danger even though it may, for the time being, anger them to the point of cutting off the friendly hand that is stretched out to help them"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","People may laugh, nevertheless that is my claim"
What would Gandhi say?,"At a time when I may have to launch the biggest struggle of my life, I may not harbour hatred against anybody"
Tell me about truth and love:,II [Gandhiji's address before the A.I.C.C
"Guide me, Gandhi:","at Bombay on 8-8-'42 delivered in Hindustani:]
I congratulate you on the resolution that you have just passed"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","In doing so, they had nothing to be ashamed of"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",For the last twenty years we have tried to learn not to lose courage even when we are in a hopeless minority and are laughed at
What would Gandhi say?,We have learned to hold on to our beliefs in the confidence that we are in the right
Tell me about truth and love:,"It behaves us to cultivate this courage of conviction, for it ennobles man and raises his moral stature"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I was, therefore, glad to see that these friends had imbibed the principle which I have tried to follow for the last fifty years and more"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Having congratulated them on their courage, let me say that what they asked this Committee to accept through their amendments was not the correct representation of the situation"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",These friends ought to have pondered over the appeal made to them by the Maulana to withdraw their amendments; they should have carefully followed the explanations given by Jawaharlal
What would Gandhi say?,"Had they done so, it would have been clear to them that the right which they now want the Congress to concede has already been conceded by the Congress"
Tell me about truth and love:,Time was when every Mussalman claimed the whole of India as his motherland
"Guide me, Gandhi:","During the years that the Ali brothers were with me, the assumption underlying all their talks and discussions was that India belonged as much to the Mussalmans as to the Hindus"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I can
testify to the fact that this was their innermost conviction and nor a mask; I lived with them for years"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I spent days and nights in their company
What would Gandhi say?,And I make bold to say that their utterances were the honest expression of their beliefs
Tell me about truth and love:,"I know 
there are some who say that I take things too readily at their face value, that I am gullible"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I do not think I am such a simpleton, nor am I so gullible as these friends take me to be"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But their criticism does not hurt me
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I should prefer to be considered gullible rather deceitful
What would Gandhi say?,What these Communist friends proposed through their amendments is nothing new
Tell me about truth and love:,It has been repeated from thousands of platforms
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Thousands of Mussalmans have told me, that if Hindu-Muslim question was to be solved satisfactorily, it must be done in my lifetime"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I should feel flattered at this; but how can I agree to proposal which does not appeal to my reason
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Hindu-Muslim unity is not a new thing
What would Gandhi say?,Millions of Hindus and Mussalmans have sought after it
Tell me about truth and love:,I consciously strove for its achievement from my boyhood
"Guide me, Gandhi:","While at school, I made it a point to cultivate the friendship of Muslims and Parsi co-students"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I believed even at that tender age that the Hindus in India, if they wished to live in peace and amity with the other communities, should assiduously cultivate the virtue of neighbourliness"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","It did not matter, I felt, if I made no special effort to cultivate the friendship with Hindus, but I must make friends with at least a few Mussalmans"
What would Gandhi say?,It was as counsel for a Mussalmans merchant that I went to South Africa
Tell me about truth and love:,"I made friends with other Mussalmans there, even with the opponents of my client, and gained a reputation for integrity and good faith"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I had among my friends and co-workers Muslims as well as Parsis
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I captured their hearts and when I left finally for India, I left them sad and shedding tears of grief at the separation"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",In India too I continued my efforts and left no stone unturned to achieve that unity
What would Gandhi say?,"It was my life-long aspiration for it that made me offer my fullest co-operation to the 
Mussalmans in the Khilafat movement"
Tell me about truth and love:,Muslims throughout the country accepted me as their true friend
"Guide me, Gandhi:",How then is it that I have now come to be regarded as so evil and detestable
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Had I any axe to grind in supporting the Khilafat movement
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","True, I did in my heart of hearts cherish a hope that it might enable me to save the cow"
What would Gandhi say?,"I believe the cow and myself to be the creation of the same God, and I am prepared to sacrifice my life in order to save the cow"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But, whatever my philosophy of life and my ultimate hopes, I joined the movement in no spirit of bargain"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I co-operated in the struggle for the Khilafat solely on order to discharge my obligation to my neighbour who, I saw, was in distress"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The Ali brothers, had they been alive today, would have testified to the truth of this assertion"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",And so would many others bear me out in that it was not a bargain on my part for saving the cow
What would Gandhi say?,"As an honest man, a true neighbour and a faithful friend, it was incumbent on me to stand by the Mussalmans in the hour of their trial"
Tell me about truth and love:,"In those days, I shocked the Hindus by dinning time they have now got used to it"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Maulana Bari told me, however, that through he would not allow me dine with him, lest some day he should be accused of a sinister motive"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","And so, whenever I had occasion to stay with him, he called a Brahmana cook and made social arrangements for separate cooking"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Firangi ,Mahal, his residence, was an old-styled structure with limited accommodation; yet he cheerfully bore all hardships and carried out his resolve from which I could not dislodge him"
What would Gandhi say?,"It was the spirit of courtesy, dignity and nobility that inspired us in those days"
Tell me about truth and love:,"They respected one another's religious feelings, and considered it a privilege to do so"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Not a trace of suspicion lurked in anybody's heart
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Where has all that dignity, that nobility of spirit, disappeared now"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I should ask all Mussalmans, including Quaid-I-Azam Jinnah, to recall those glorious days and to find out what has brought us to the present impasse"
What would Gandhi say?,Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah himself was at one time a Congressman
Tell me about truth and love:,"If today the Congress has incurred his wrath, it is because the canker of suspicion has entered his heart"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","May God bless him with long life, but when I am gone, he will realize and admit that I had no designs on Mussalmans and that I had never betrayed their interests"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Where is the escape for me, if I injure their cause or betray their interests"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",My life is entirely at their disposal
What would Gandhi say?,"They are free to put an end to it, whenever they wish to do so"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Assaults have been made on my life in the past, but God has spared me till now, and the assailants have repented for their action"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","But if someone were to shoot me in the belief that he was getting rid of a rascal, he would kill not the real Gandhi, but the one that appeared to him a rascal"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","To those who have been indulging in a campaign of a abuse and vilification I would say, ""Islam enjoins you not to revile even an enemy"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The Prophet treated even enemies with kindness and tried to win them over by his fairness and generosity
What would Gandhi say?,Are you followers of that Islam or of any other
Tell me about truth and love:,"If you are followers of the true Islam, does it behave you to distrust the words of one who makes a public declaration of his faith"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","To me, these abuses are like bullets"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","They can kill me, even as a bullet can put an end to my life"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",But what of those who indulge in abusing
What would Gandhi say?,"For the fair name of Islam, I appeal to you to resist this unceasing campaign of abuse and vilification"
Tell me about truth and love:,Maulana Saheb is being made a target for the filthiest abuse
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Because he refuses to exert on me the pressure of his friendship
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",He realizes that it is a misuse of friendship to seek up to compel a friend to accept as truth what he knows is an untruth
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",To the Quaid-Azam I would say: Whatever is true and valid in the claim for Pakistan is already in your hands
What would Gandhi say?,"What is wrong and untenable is in nobody's gift, so that it can be made over to you"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Even if someone were to succeed in imposing an untruth on others, he would not be able to enjoy for long the fruits of such a coercion"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",God dislikes pride and keeps away from it
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",God would not tolerate a forcible imposition of an untruth
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The Quaid-Azam says that he is compelled to say bitter things but that he cannot help giving expression to his thoughts and his feelings
What would Gandhi say?,"Similarly I would say : ""I consider myself a friend of Mussalmans"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Why should I then not give expression to the things nearest to my heart, even at the cost of displeasing them"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",How can I conceal my innermost thoughts from them
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I should congratulate the Quaid-i-Azam on his frankness in giving expression to his thoughts and feelings, even if they sound bitter to his hearers"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But even so why should the Mussalmans sitting here be reviled, if they do not see eye to eye with him"
What would Gandhi say?,If millions of Mussalmans are with you can you not afford to ignore the handful of Mussalmans who may appear to you to be misguided
Tell me about truth and love:,"Why should one with the following of several millions be afraid of a majority community, or of the minority being swamped by the majority"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",How did the Prophet work among the Arabs and the Mussalmans
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Did he say he would propagate Islam only when he commanded a majority
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I appeal to you for the sake of Islam to ponder over what I say
What would Gandhi say?,"There is neither fair play nor justice in saying that the Congress must accept a thing, even if it does not believe in it and even if it goes counter to principles it holds dear"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Rajaji said:""I do not believe in Pakistan"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Jinnah asks for it, and it has become an obsession with them"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Why not then say, ""yes"" to them just now"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If I hold the demand to be just, I should concede it this very day"
What would Gandhi say?,I should not agree to it merely in order to placate Jinnah Saheb
Tell me about truth and love:,Many friends have come and asked me to agree to it for the time being to placate Mr
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Jinnah, disarm his suspicious and to see how he reacts to it"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But I cannot be party to a course of action with a false promise
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","At any rate, it is not my method."" The Congress as no sanction but the moral one for enforcing its decisions"
What would Gandhi say?,It believes that true democracy can only be the outcome of non-violence
Tell me about truth and love:,"The structure of a world federation can be raised only on a foundation of non-violence, and violence will have to be totally abjured from world affairs"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","If this is true, the solution of Hindu-Muslim question, too, cannot be achieved by a resort to violence"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If the Hindus tyrannize over the Mussalmans, with what face will they talk of a world federation"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is for the same reason that I do not believe in the possibility of establishing world peace through violence as the English and American statesmen propose to do
What would Gandhi say?,The Congress has agreed to submitting all the differences to an impartial international tribunal and to abide by its decisions
Tell me about truth and love:,"If even this fairest of proposals is unacceptable, the only course that remains open is that of the sword, of violence"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",How can I persuade myself to agree to an impossibility
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",To demand the vivisection of a living organism is to ask for its very life
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The Congress cannot be party to such a fratricidal war
What would Gandhi say?,"Moonje and Shri Savarkar, believe in the doctrine of the sword may seek to keep the Mussalmans under Hindus domination"
Tell me about truth and love:,I do not represent that section
"Guide me, Gandhi:",You want to kill the Congress which is the goose that lays golden eggs
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If you distrust the Congress, you may rest assured that there is to be perpetual war between the Hindus and the Mussalmans, and the country will be doomed to continue warfare and bloodshed"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If such warfare is to be our lot, I shall not live to witness it"
What would Gandhi say?,One thing which was uppermost in my heart I have already dealt with
Tell me about truth and love:,You may take it from me that it is with me a matter of life and death
"Guide me, Gandhi:","If we Hindus and Mussalmans mean to achieve a heart unity, without the slightest mental reservation on the part of either, we must first unite in the effort to be free from the shackles of this empire"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If Pakistan after all is to be a portion of India, what objection can there be for Mussalmans against joining this struggle for India's freedom"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The Hindus and Mussalmans must, therefore, unite in the first instance on the issue of fighting for freedom"
What would Gandhi say?,Jinnah Saheb thinks the war will last long
Tell me about truth and love:,"If the war goes on for six months more, how shall we able to save China"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I, therefore, want freedom immediately, this very night, before dawn, if it can be had"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Freedom cannot now wait for the realization of communal unity
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If that unity is not achieved, sacrifices necessary for it will have to be much greater than would have otherwise sufficed"
What would Gandhi say?,But the Congress must win freedom or be wiped out in the effort
Tell me about truth and love:,And forget not that the freedom which the Congress is struggling to achieve will not be for the Congressmen alone but for all the forty cores of the Indian people
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Congressmen must for ever remain humble servants of the people
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","The Quaid-i-Azam has said that the Muslim League is prepared to take over the rule from the Britishers if they are prepared to hand it over to the Muslim League, for the British took over the empire from the hands of the Muslims"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","This, however, will be Muslim Raj"
What would Gandhi say?,The offer made by Maulana Saheb and by me does not imply establishment of Muslim Raj or Muslim domination
Tell me about truth and love:,The Congress does not believe in the domination of any group or any community
"Guide me, Gandhi:","It believes in democracy which includes in its orpit Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Parsis, Jews-every one of the communities inhabiting this vast country"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If Muslim Raj is invetable, then let it be; but how can we give it the stamp of our assent"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",How can we agree to the domination of one community over the others
What would Gandhi say?,Millions of Mussalmans in this country come from Hindu stock
Tell me about truth and love:,How can their homeland be any other than India
"Guide me, Gandhi:",My eldest son embraced Islam some years back
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",What would his homeland be-Porbandar or the Punjab
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I ask the Mussalmans: ""If India is not your homeland, what other country do you belong to"
What would Gandhi say?,"In what separate homeland would you put my son who embraced Islam?"" His mother wrote him a letter after his conversion, asking him if he had on embracing Islam given up drinking which Islam forbids to its follower"
Tell me about truth and love:,"To those who gloated over the conversion, she wrote to say: ""I do not mind his becoming a Mussalmans, so much as his drinking"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Will you, as pious Mussalmans, tolerate his drinking even after his conversion"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",He has reduced himself to the state of a rake by drinking
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If you are going to make a man of him again, his conversion will have been turned to good account"
What would Gandhi say?,"You will, therefore, please see that he as a Mussalman abjures wine and woman"
Tell me about truth and love:,"If that change does not come about, his conversion goes in vain and our non-co-operation with him will have to continue."" India is without doubt the homeland of all the Mussalmans inhabiting this country"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Every Mussalman should therefore co-operate in the fight for India's freedom
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The Congress does not belong to any one class or community; it belongs to the whole nation
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is open to Mussalmans to take possession of the Congress
What would Gandhi say?,"They can, if they like, swamp the Congress by their numbers, and can steer it along the course which appeals to them"
Tell me about truth and love:,"The Congress is fighting not on behalf of the Hindu but on behalf of the whole nation, including the minorities"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It would hurt me to hear of a single instance of a Mussalman being killed by a Congressman
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","In the coming revolution, Congressmen will sacrifice their lives in order to protect the Mussalman against a Hindu's attack and vice versa"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","It is a part of their creed, and is one of the essentials of non-violence"
What would Gandhi say?,You will be excepted on occasions like these not to lose your heads
Tell me about truth and love:,"Every Congressman, whether a Hindu or a Mussalman, owes this duty to the organization to which will render a service to Islam"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Mutual trust is essential for success in the final nation-wide struggle that is to come
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I have said that much greater sacrifice will have to be made this time in the wake of our struggle because of the opposition from the Muslim League and from Englishmen
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",You have seen the secret circular issued by Sir Frederick Puckle
What would Gandhi say?,It is a suicidal course that he has taken
Tell me about truth and love:,It contains an open incitement to organizations which crop up like mushrooms to combine to fight the Congress
"Guide me, Gandhi:",We have thus to deal with an empire whose ways are crooked
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Ours is a straight path which we can tread even with our eyes closed
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",That is the beauty of Satyagraha
What would Gandhi say?,"In Satyagraha, there is no place for fraud or falsehood, or any kind of untruth"
Tell me about truth and love:,Fraud and untruth today are stalking the world
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I cannot be a helpless witness to such a situation
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I have traveled all over India as perhaps nobody in the present age has
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","The voiceless millions of the land saw in me their friend and representative, and I identified myself with them to an extent it was possible for a human being to do"
What would Gandhi say?,"I saw trust in their eyes, which I now want to turn to good account in fighting this empire upheld on untruth and violence"
Tell me about truth and love:,"However gigantic the preparations that the empire has made, we must get out of its clutches"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",How can I remain silent at this supreme hour and hide my light under the bushel
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Shall I ask the Japanese to tarry awhile
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If today I sit quite and inactive, God will take me to task for not using up the treasure He had given me, in the midst of the conflagration that is enveloping the whole world"
What would Gandhi say?,"Had the condition been different, I should have asked you to wait yet awhile"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But the situation now has become intolerable, and the Congress has no other course left for it"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Nevertheless, the actual struggle does not commence this moment"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",You have only placed all your powers in my hands
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I will now wait upon the Viceroy and plead with him for the acceptance of the Congress demand
What would Gandhi say?,That process is likely to take two or three weeks
Tell me about truth and love:,What would you do in the meanwhile
"Guide me, Gandhi:","What is the programme, for the interval, in which all can participate"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","As you know, the spinning wheel is the first thing that occurs to me"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I made the same answer to the Maulana
What would Gandhi say?,"He would have none of it, though he understood its import later"
Tell me about truth and love:,"The fourteen fold constructive programme is, of course, there for you to carry out"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Every one of you should, from this moment onwards, consider yourself a free man or woman, and acts as if you are free and are no longer under the heel of this imperialism"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is not a make-believe that I am suggesting to you
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is the very essence of freedom
What would Gandhi say?,The bond of the slave is snapped the moment he consider himself to be a free being
Tell me about truth and love:,"He will plainly tell the master: ""I was your bond slave till this moment, but I am a slave no longer"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","You may kill me if you like, but if you keep me alive, I wish to tell you that if you release me from the bondage, of your own accord, I will ask for nothing more from you"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","You used to feed and cloth me, though I could have provided food and clothing for myself by my labour"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I hitherto depended on you instead of on God, for food and raiment"
What would Gandhi say?,"But God has now inspired me with an urge for freedom and I am to day a free man, and will no longer depend on you."" You may take it from me that I am not going to strike a bargain with the Viceroy for ministries and the like"
Tell me about truth and love:,I am not going to be satisfied with anything short of complete freedom
"Guide me, Gandhi:","May be, he will propose the abolition of salt tax, the drink evil, etc"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","But I will say, ""Nothing less than freedom."" Here is a mantra, a short one, that I give you"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",You may imprint it on your hearts and let every breath of yours give expression to it
What would Gandhi say?,We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall not live to see the perpetuation of our slavery
Tell me about truth and love:,Every true Congressman or woman will join the struggle with an inflexible determination not to remain alive to see the country in bondage and slavery
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Keep jails out of your consideration
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","If the Government keep me free, I will not put on the Government the strain of maintaining a large number of prisoners at a time, when it is in trouble"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Let every man and woman live every moment of his or her life hereafter in the consciousness that he or she eats or lives for achieving freedom and will die, if need be, to attain that goal"
What would Gandhi say?,"Take a pledge, with God and your own conscience as witness, that you will no longer rest till freedom is achieved and will be prepared to lay down your lives in the attempt to achieve it"
Tell me about truth and love:,He who loses his life will gain it; he who will seek to save it shall lose it
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Freedom is not for the coward or the faint-hearted
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I congratulate you on the support you have hitherto given to the national demand
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I know the restrictions and handicaps under which you have to labour
What would Gandhi say?,But I would now ask you to snap the chains that bind you
Tell me about truth and love:,It should be the proud privilege of the newspapers to lead and set an example in laying down one's life for freedom
"Guide me, Gandhi:",You have the pen which the Government can't suppress
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I know you have large properties in the form of printing presses, etc., and you would be afraid lest the Government should attach them"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I do not ask you to invite an attachment of the printing-press voluntarily
What would Gandhi say?,"For myself, I would not suppress my pen, even if the press was to be attached"
Tell me about truth and love:,As you know my press was attached in the past and returned later on
"Guide me, Gandhi:",But I do not ask from you that final sacrifice
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","You should now wind up your standing committee, and you may declare that you will give up the pen only when India has won her freedom"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","You may tell Sir Frederick Puckle that he can't except from you a command performance, that his press notes are full of untruth, and that you will refuse to publish them"
What would Gandhi say?,You will openly declare that you are wholeheartedly with the Congress
Tell me about truth and love:,"If you do this, you will have changed the atmosphere before the fight actually begins"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",From the Princes I ask with all respect due to them a very small thing
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I am a well-wisher of the Princes
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",My grandfather refused to salute with his right hand any Prince other than his own
What would Gandhi say?,"But he did not say to the Prince, as I fell he ought to have said, that even his own master could not compel him, his minister, to act against his conscience"
Tell me about truth and love:,I have eaten the Prince's salt and I would not be false to it
"Guide me, Gandhi:","As a faithful servant, it is my duty to warn the Princes that if they will act while I am still alive, the Princes may come to occupy an honourable place in free India"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","In Jawaharlal's scheme of free India, no privileges or the privileged classes have a place"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",Jawaharlal considers all property to be State-owned
What would Gandhi say?,He wants to reconstruct India according to plan
Tell me about truth and love:,I have kept a place for the Princes and the Zamindars1 in India that I envisage
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I would ask the Princes in all humility to enjoy through renunciation
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",The Princes may renounce ownership over their properties and become their trustees in the true sense of the term
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I visualize God in the assemblage of people
What would Gandhi say?,"The Princes may say to their people : ""You are the owners and masters of the State and we are your servants."" I would ask the Princes to become servants of the people and render to them an account of their own services"
Tell me about truth and love:,"The empire too bestows power on the Princes, but they should prefer to derive power from their own people; and if they want to indulge in some innocent pleasures, they may seek to do so as servants of the people"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I do not want the Princes to live as paupers
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","But I would ask them : ""Do you want to remain slaves for all time"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Why should you, instead of paying homage to a foreign power, not accept the sovereignty of your own people?"" You may write to the Political Department : ""The people are now awake"
What would Gandhi say?,How are we to withstand an avalanche before which even the Large empire are crumbling
Tell me about truth and love:,"We, therefore, shall belong to the people from today onwards"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","We shall sink or swim with them."" Believe me, there is nothing unconstitutional in the course I am suggesting"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","There are, so far as I know, no treaties enabling the empire to coerce the Princes"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Nothing, however, should be done secretly"
What would Gandhi say?,In this struggle secrecy is a sin
Tell me about truth and love:,A free man would not engage in a secret movement
"Guide me, Gandhi:",It is likely that when you gain freedom you will have a C.I.D
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","of your own, in spite of my advice to the contrary"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","But in the present struggle, we have to work openly and to receive bullets on our chest, without taking to heels"
What would Gandhi say?,I have a word to say to Government servants also
Tell me about truth and love:,"They may not, if they like, resign their posts yet"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","The late Justice Ranade did not resign his post, but he openly declared that he belonged to the Congress"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","He said to the Government that though he was a judge, he was a Congressman and would openly attend the sessions of the Congress, but that at the same time he would not let his political views warp his impartiality on the bench"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",He held Social Reform Conference in the very Pandal1 of the Congress
What would Gandhi say?,I would ask all the Government servants to follow in the footsteps of Ranade and to declare their allegiance to the Congress as an answer to the secret circular issued by Sir Frederick Puckle
Tell me about truth and love:,This is all that I ask of you just now
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I will now write to the Viceroy
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",You will be able to read the correspondence not just now but when I publish it with the Viceroy's consent
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",But you are free to aver that you support the demand to be put forth in my letter
What would Gandhi say?,"A judge came to me and said : ""We get secret circulars from high quarters"
Tell me about truth and love:,"What are we to do?"" I replied, ""If I were in your place, I would ignore the circulars"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",You may openly say to the Government : 'I have received your secret circular
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","I am, however, with the Congress"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Though I serve the Government for my livelihood, I am not going to obey these secret circulars or to employ underhand methods,'"" Soldiers too are covered by the present programme"
What would Gandhi say?,I do not ask them just now to resign their posts and to leave the army
Tell me about truth and love:,"The soldiers come to me, Jawaharlal and the Maulana and say : ""We are wholly with you"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","We are tired of the Governmental tyranny."" To these soldiers I would say : You may say to the Government, ""Our hearts are with the Congress"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",We are not going to leave our posts
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",We will serve you so long as we receive your salaries
What would Gandhi say?,"We will obey your just orders, but will refuse to fire on our own people."" To those who lack the courage to do this much I have nothing to say"
Tell me about truth and love:,"But if you can do this much, you may take it from me that the whole atmosphere will be electrified"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Let the Government then shower bombs, if they like"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",But no power on earth will then be able to keep you in bondage any longer
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If the students want to join the struggle only to go back to their studies after a while, I would not invite them to it"
What would Gandhi say?,"For the present, however, till the time that I frame a programme for the struggle, I would ask the students to say to their professors : ""We belong to the Congress"
Tell me about truth and love:,"Do you belong to the Congress, or to the Government"
"Guide me, Gandhi:","If you belong to the Congress, you need not vacate your posts"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","You will remain at your posts but teach us and lead us unto freedom."" In all fights for freedom, the world over, the students have made very large contributions"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","If in the interval that is left to us before the actual fight begins, you do even the little I have suggested to you, you will have changed the atmosphere and will have prepared the ground for the next step"
What would Gandhi say?,There is much I should et like to say
Tell me about truth and love:,I have already taken up much of your time
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I have yet to say a few words in English also
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I thank you for the patience and attention with which you have listened to me even at this late hour
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is just what true soldiers would do
What would Gandhi say?,"For the last twenty-two years, I have controlled my speech and pen and have stored up my energy"
Tell me about truth and love:,He is a true Brahmacharri1 who does not fritter away his energy
"Guide me, Gandhi:","He will, therefore, always control his speech"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",That has been my conscious effort all these years
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",But today the occasion has come when I had to unburden my heart before you
What would Gandhi say?,"I have done so, even though it meant putting a strain on your patience; and I do not regret having done it"
Tell me about truth and love:,I have given you my message and through you I have delivered it to the whole of India
"Guide me, Gandhi:",III [The following is the concluding portion of Gandhiji's speech before the A.I.C.C
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","at Bombay on 8-8-`42 which was delivered in English]: I have taken such an inordinately long time over pouring out, what was agitating my soul, to those whom I had just now the privilege of serving"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","I have been called their leader or, in the military language, their commander"
What would Gandhi say?,But I do not look at my position in that light
Tell me about truth and love:,I have no weapon but love to wield my authority over any one
"Guide me, Gandhi:",I do sport a stick which you can break into bits without the slightest exertion
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",It is simply my staff with the help of which I walk
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","Such a cripple is not elated, when he has been called upon to bear the greatest burden"
What would Gandhi say?,You can share that burden only when I appear before you not as your commander but as a humble servant
Tell me about truth and love:,And he who serves best is the chief among equals
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Therefore, I was bound to share with you such thoughts as were welling up in my breast and tell you, in as summary a manner as I can, what I except you to do as the first step"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Let me tell you at the outset that the real struggle does not commence today
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I have yet to go through much ceremonial as I always do
What would Gandhi say?,"The burden, I confess, would be almost unbearable"
Tell me about truth and love:,I have to continue to reason in those circles with whom I have lost my credit and who have no trust left in me
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I know that in the course of the last few weeks I have forfeited my credit with a large number of friends, so much so, that they have begun to doubt not only my wisdom but even my honesty"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Now I hold my wisdom is not such a treasure which I cannot afford to lose; but my honesty is a precious treasure to me and I can ill-afford to lose it
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I seem however to have lost it for the time being
What would Gandhi say?,Friend of the Empire Such occasions arise in the life of the man who is a pure seeker after truth and who would seek to serve the humanity and his country to the best of his lights without fear or hypocrisy
Tell me about truth and love:,For the last fifty years I have known no other way
"Guide me, Gandhi:","I have been a humble servant of humanity and have rendered on more than one occasion such services as I could to the Empire, and here let me say without fear of challenge that throughout my career never have I asked for any personal favour"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",I have enjoyed the privilege of friendship as I enjoy it today with Lord Linlithgow
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",It is a friendship which has outgrown official relationship
What would Gandhi say?,"Whether Lord Linlithgow will bear me out, I do not know, but there is a personal bond between him and myself"
Tell me about truth and love:,He once introduced me to his daughter
"Guide me, Gandhi:",he fell in love with Mahadev more than with me and Lady Anna and he came to me
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",She is an obedient and favourite daughter
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",I take interest in their welfare
What would Gandhi say?,I will have to resist the might of that Empire with the might of the dumb millions with no limit but of nonviolence as policy confined to this struggle
Tell me about truth and love:,It is a terrible job to have to offer resistance to a Viceroy with whom I enjoy such relations

"Guide me, Gandhi:","Sjahriar, the Premier of Indonesia, made the following speech:] I do not think that I should apologize to you for having to speak in a foreign tongue"

What would Gandhi say?,I was going to tell you that I do not wish to apologize

"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",The fast begins from the first meal tomorrow
What would Gandhi say?,The period is indefinite and I may drink water with or without salts and sour limes
Tell me about truth and love:,"It will end when and if I am satisfied that there is a reunion of hearts of all the communities brought about without any outside pressure, but from an awakened sense of duty"
"Guide me, Gandhi:",The reward will be the regaining of India's dwindling prestige and her fast fading sovereignty over the heart of Asia and there through the world

"Your philosophy, Mahatma:",Critics have regarded some of my previous fasts as coercive and held that on merits the verdict would have gone against my stand but for the pressure exercised by the fasts
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:",What value can an adverse verdict have when the purpose is demonstrably sound
What would Gandhi say?,"A pure fast, like duty, is its own reward"
Tell me about truth and love:,I do not embark upon it for the sake of the result it may bring
"Guide me, Gandhi:","Hence, I urge everybody dispassionately to examine the purpose and let me die, if I must, in peace which I hope is ensured"
"Your philosophy, Mahatma:","Death for me would be a glorious deliverance rather than that I should be a helpless witness of the destruction of India, Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam"
"Gandhi, share your wisdom:","That destruction is certain if Pakistan ensures no equality of status and security of life and property for all professing the various faiths of the world, and if India copies her"
What would Gandhi say?,"Only then Islam dies in the two India's, not in the world"
Tell me about truth and love:,But Hinduism and Sikhism have no world outside India
"Guide me, Gandhi:",Those who differ from me will be honoured by me for their resistance however implacable
